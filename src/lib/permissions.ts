// Permission catalog shared by client UI and server authorization.
// Server code resolves a caller's effective permissions through
// src/lib/serverAuthz.ts using this catalog; the UI only mirrors it.
//
// Backward compatibility ("legacy roles"): documents in club_roles written
// before this catalog existed have no `permissions` array. Those roles keep
// exactly the authority they had under the previous model — matching the
// Firestore rules, where any approved admin could read/update users, write
// events/resources/gallery/settings, but only the CTO could delete accounts,
// manage team access or edit roles. resolveRolePermissions() encodes that.
// CTO always holds every permission (protected invariant).
